<p>My name is Donald Loveland and I am a first year PhD student in the CSE department at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, advised by <a href="https://gemslab.github.io">Danai Koutra</a>. My work is supported by a <a href="https://rackham.umich.edu/funding/funding-types/rackham-merit-fellowship-program/">Rackham Merit Fellowship award</a>. </p>
<h1 id="research">Research</h1>
<p>My research focuses on improving the interpretability, robustness, and fairness of graph neural networks with hopes to mitigate harmful bias and identify practical limitations of current methods.</p>
<p>Previously, I was a machine learning research scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Lab where I broadly worked on graph deep learning applications. Some of my specific research included graph classification/regression for molecules, inverse design of molecular graphs, post-hoc insight extraction for graph neural networks (GNNs), and adversarial training for GNNs.</p>
<p>In the past, I have also worked heavily in the computer vision space developing methods to extract actionable insights from convolution neural networks through generative counterfactual models.</p>
<p>Before I was a researcher, I worked as a software engineer at Chevron where I developed an automated API based deployment strategy for machine learning applications to Azure.</p>
<h1 id="mentoring">Mentoring</h1>
<p>I am grateful for the opportunities I have recieved during both my academics and professional career given my background as a first generation student. While I am still figuring out how to properly navigate the world of academia, I have worked to make myself a resource for others who come from similar backgrounds. During my undergraduate degree, I acted as a peer mentor for younger first generation students who were on academic probation, and I have continued these efforts by participating in undergraduate mentoring during my graduate studies. While at Lawrence Livermore, I also helped facilitate a two week long <a href="https://www.llnl.gov/news/lockdown-doesnt-hinder-annual-data-science-challenge">machine learning challenge</a> geared towards teaching students how to perform applied research. I am always happy to help others who are looking for advice, please feel free to reach out!</p>
