<p>My name is Donald Loveland and I am a first year PhD student in the CSE department at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, advised by <a href="https://gemslab.github.io">Danai Koutra</a>. My work is supported by a <a href="https://rackham.umich.edu/funding/funding-types/rackham-merit-fellowship-program/">Rackham Merit Fellowship award</a>. My research focuses on improving the interpretability, robustness, and fairness of graph neural networks with hopes to mitigate harmful bias and identify practical limitations of current methods. </p>
<p>Previously, I was a machine learning research scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Lab where I broadly worked on graph deep learning applications. Some of my specific research included graph classification/regression for molecules, inverse design of molecular graphs, post-hoc insight extraction for graph neural networks (GNNs), and adversarial training for GNNs. </p>
<p>In the past, I have also worked heavily in the computer vision space developing methods to extract actionable insights from convolution neural networks through generative counterfactual models. </p>
<p>Before I was a researcher, I worked as a software engineer at Chevron where I developed an automated API based deployment strategy for machine learning applications to Azure.</p>
<p>I primarily work with python and focus on multiple machine/deep learning packages such as scikit-learn, keras, and pytorch.</p>
